    works and have to do multiple tasks frequently, dual monitors make the complicated situation less painful and increase work efficiency. In this part of the article, you will get some instructions to set up the dual-screen as well as get to know the
    benefits of working with such workstations. How to Set Up a Dual Monitor The number of people using multiple monitors is increasing day by day. It allows doing numerous tasks with great productivity. Adding a second monitor is pretty easy with these
    instructions here. Your first duty is to buy a desk that can accommodate two exact sizes of monitors. I would recommend you to go for the same size because your tasks mainly depend on their positions and designs. You have to be very at ease with them;
    otherwise, it will cause injury to the neck if it is not in a neutral posture. The proper setup of a Dual monitor depends on three factors- 1. Percentage of using each monitor 2. Performing work type 3. Your dominant eye Both Monitors are used Equally
    If you use both of the monitors equally, they should be placed close together at the middle of the desk directly center in front of you. Angle the screens slightly to make space more even. The outer edges must be close to you than the inner like a
    semi-circle. Their inner edges should be straight to your nose to ensure the tops even with your eye level. This position would help your neck to keep straight while using screens. You should face the monitors at an arm's length away about 18-28 inches.
    One Monitor is the Primary If you use one for your active daily projects and another for business dealing, for example, using mail or other social accounts there, place the primary one in the center directly in front of you like I before said. Place
    the second one beside the primary monitor on the side of your dominant eye. It should be next to the primary monitor at the same height and distance. Angle the screen of the second monitor slightly to see the screen from an equidistant. While using
    each monitor, just angle the mouse and the keyboard slightly towards them to avoid strain on your wrists and arms. Benefits of setting up Dual Monitor Setup Working with two monitor setups can still be a hazard for some people. Many of us feel it
    is a juggling act to do as it is less popular than the single monitor setup. But once you started using dual-screen, you will get adjusted to it. You will feel bore and difficult to manage the whole work switching to the single screen. Here's a look
    at some of the reasons why you should choose a dual-screen setup instead of the regular one. • Increasing Productivity The primary advantage of working with dual monitors is enhanced productivity. There are a lot of surveys that show that dual screens
    are significantly more productive than single ones. People get distracted or lose their motions during working remotely. Dual monitors help to eliminate boredom and make you feel more focused on your work. If you are a programmer and face many problems
    working with single monitors, a dual-screen will ease your pain. For instance, you can do coding on one screen and programming on the other one at a time. You don't have to jump back and forth between tabs while doing multiple tasks. • Better Multitasking
    for The Designer Designers do different types of the workflow by using lots of programs in a concise time. So they need to toggle back and forth between an internet browser and FTP applications or maybe an illustrator and HTML editor. They cannot
    waste their time by switching various programs and resizing windows as it is more painful and unproductive. Using dual monitors, they can focus completely on their tasks and keep different applications visible. A single monitor cannot provide you
    this benefit to work more efficiently. • Image and Video Editing It is tough to alternate every time between tabs to do different things. It takes much time to close one window and open another. Repeating the same process time and again causes a colossal
    waste of time. But you can quickly fix this problem with dual monitors. Now you don't have to put all the editing tools on the top of your video. Put your image on one screen and numerous editing tools on the other one so that all the things may be
    better visible for you. As a result, you will do fewer errors and do have to waste your valuable time. • Can Keep Email and Twitter Account on one screen You can use your mail or Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts all the time by using a dual monitor.
    You can leave them open on one screen and work with other documents on the second screen. You can stay connected while in your mail account without reducing productivity. Also, you can stay focused the whole day with your work until the second screen
    pop up with any notification. A dual monitor helps you collaborate easily with your clients, share ideas, and stay connected on certain tasks on another screen. Thus, you will feel more enjoyable working remotely. • Works Well with Laptops Many of
    us do work with laptops while office going people are habituated to desktop or computer. So, can't we enjoy the taste of using dual monitors? Actually, it is effortless to connect the laptop with an additional monitor and work like homely. It takes
    only a single minute to set up your laptop with the second screen and disconnect also. Thus, you can take the laptop and go anywhere you need. • Using Skype While Still Having Access to Other Data If you use a dual monitor in this case, it would be
    straightforward to have a video conference along with other things. You can show some points or something else through one monitor and do a video conference using the second screen. • Product Comparison Using two monitors at the same time helps you
    to compare various products and choose the best one. Suppose, you are going to buy shoes from online, so must know all the key features and details of each of the product. Having two monitors side by side helps you to view the characteristics and
    compare the differences. Thus, you can buy the best shoe for you online. But it would be difficult if you had to use the single monitor and jump back and forth to view the features from one tab to another. It would cause a massive waste of your time
    too. FAQs Due to the larger screen and increased visibility, dual monitors are getting hyped day by day. Here are some questions that you might love to know. 1. How big of a desk do you need for 2 monitors? The minimum sizes of popular dual monitors
    are 24". So you need to buy a big size desk like 50-55 inches that would be easy for you to set the dual monitors as well as the extra things on it. 2. Where should I put speakers for dual monitors? You should place them in such a position where you
    would be in the middle, and their distance would be equal to both of your ears. You can set both of them in an equilateral triangle position so that it would be easy for you to receive sounds equally from the two speakers. 3. How much space do you
    have for a desk? You have to look for enough space for keeping the desk. Measure out the place where you want to keep it and set the appearance according to your choice. 4. How do you position two monitors on a desk? Do not make the monitors too high
    or low. I would suggest you place the monitors in such a position to face each of them head-on. 5. What is a good desk size? Usually, the office desks are of standard size that is 60 inches in width and 30 inches deep. You need the depth to fit a
    monitor stand and keyboard. Final Words Having multiple doors lead you to many choices, but you can't be mistaken with any of the desks mentioned above. But I would suggest you go with your preference. Only you know what you need. Well, if you ask
    me which is the best desk for dual monitors, I will say Walker Edison Ellis Dual Monitor Desk. The reasons are endless, including, affordability, various usages, detailed instructions, and assembling tools. For now, it's time to say goodbye. See you
    at the desk. Happy Computing! Meta Description The best desk for dual monitors is not just some desk you regularly see in the office or home. These types of desks improve your productivity and working efficiency.
